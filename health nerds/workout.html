            <p> <h3>IMPORTANCE OF STRETCHING</h3>
              <hr>
        
      
              You may think of stretching as something performed only by runners or gymnasts. But we all need to stretch in order to protect our mobility and independence. "A lot of people don't understand that stretching has to happen on a regular basis. It should be daily," says David Nolan, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
              <br>
              <br>
            <h4>why stretching is important?</h4>
            <br>
            Stretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints. Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are weak and unable to extend all the way. That puts you at risk for joint pain, strains, and muscle damage.
            For example, sitting in a chair all day results in tight hamstrings in the back of the thigh. That can make it harder to extend your leg or straighten your knee all the way, which inhibits walking. Likewise, when tight muscles are suddenly called on for a strenuous activity that stretches them, such as playing tennis, they may become damaged from suddenly being stretched. Injured muscles may not be strong enough to support the joints, which can lead to joint injury.

            Regular stretching keeps muscles long, lean, and flexible, and this means that exertion "won't put too much force on the muscle itself," says Nolan. Healthy muscles also help a person with balance problems to avoid falls 
            <br>
            <br>
          <h4>where to start?</h4>
        
        With a body full of muscles, the idea of daily stretching may seem overwhelming. But Nolan says you don't have to stretch every muscle you have. "The areas critical for mobility are in your lower extremities: your calves, your hamstrings, your hip flexors in the pelvis and quadriceps in the front of the thigh." Stretching your shoulders, neck, and lower back is also beneficial. Aim for a program of daily stretches or at least three or four times per week.

        Find a physical therapist (your local Y is a good place to start) who can assess your muscle strength and tailor a stretching program to fit your needs. If you have chronic conditions such as Parkinson's disease or arthritis, you'll want to clear a new stretching regimen with your doctor before you start.

                Get on the floor on all fours, positioning your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Don't lock out the elbows; keep them slightly bent. Extend your legs back so you are balanced on your hands and toes, your feet hip-width apart.

                  <li>Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows and lower yourself to the floor, until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.</li>
                  <li>Exhale while contracting your chest muscles and pushing back up through your hands, returning to the start position. </li>

              <h3>BENEFITS OF DOING  PUSH-UPS</h3>
              <P>
                The abdominal muscles used to hold the body rigid during the push-up are the rectus abdominis and the internal and external obliques.2 As the push-up involves multiple joints, it is a compound exercise.

The upper body muscles that come into play in the push-up are the deltoids of the shoulders, the pectoral muscles of the chest, the triceps and biceps of the upper arm, the gluteal or hip muscles, and the erector spinae of the back.1

In daily life, you often need to push against objects, from doors to shopping carts. The functional fitness you develop with push-ups provides the strength needed to perform these movements. Working the stabilizer muscles around the shoulders can help protect you from rotator cuff injuries.3

A 2019 study also found that people who can do 40 push-ups have fewer cardiovascular disease events than those who cannot complete 10 push-ups.

            <p>Situps are classic abdominal exercises done by lying on your back and lifting your torso. They use your body weight to strengthen and tone the core-stabilizing abdominal muscles.

              Situps work the rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and obliques in addition to your hip flexors, chest, and neck. They promote good posture by working your lower back and gluteal muscles.
              
              With a larger range of motion, situps target more muscles than crunches and static core exercises. This makes them an ideal addition to your fitness program. Read on to learn about some of the benefits of situps, how to do them, and variations.

          </p>
          <li><b>Improved muscle mass</b></li>
          <p>Situps build muscle strength in the abdominal and hip muscles. Situp performance may be a useful indicator of muscle loss. According to research from 2016, older women who were able to do situps were less likely to have sarcopenia, which is the natural loss of muscle due to aging.

            Women who were able to do more than 10 situps had higher levels of muscle mass and function. While these results are promising, more research is needed to expand upon these findings.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up.

              Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus. The squat also isometrically uses the erector spinae and the abdominal muscles, among others.
              
              The squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of powerlifting, together with the deadlift and the bench press. It is also considered a staple exercise in many popular recreational exercise programs.

            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1590556409527-40916236bdd3?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80" width="1170px" alt="this is a picture of someone doing a pushup"> 
            <p>A lunge can refer to any position of the human body where one leg is positioned forward with knee bent and foot flat on the ground while the other leg is positioned behind. It is used by athletes in cross-training for sports, by weight-trainers as a fitness exercise, and by practitioners of yoga as part of an asana regimen.

              In contrast to the split squat exercise, during the lunge the rear leg is also activated.
            <br><br>
          <h4>Strength training</h4>
          Lunges are a good exercise for strengthening, sculpting and building several muscles/muscle groups, including the quadriceps (or thighs), the gluteus maximus (or buttocks) as well as the hamstrings. A long lunge emphasizes the use of the gluteals whereas a short lunge emphasizes the quadriceps. The lunge is a basic movement that is fairly simple to do for beginner athletes.
          A lunge can be performed using bodyweight alone. However, weight trainers may seek to increase the difficulty using either dumbbells or kettlebells held in each hand, or a barbell held atop the neck and shoulders. Grip strength may be an issue with the dumbbell lunge so practitioners may prefer the barbell lunge.

          As a variation, plyometric lunges (also known as split squat jumps) can be performed by jumping explosively between lunge positions.
          
          With resistance training it's not recommended to do forward lunges in place, this is due to the shear force it can place on the rear knee once the front leg no longer provides support.

            <p>Climbing a mountain would be a daunting workout to most, but what if the mountain is the floor? That's the concept behind mountain climbers. Performed from a plank position, you'll alternate bringing one knee to your chest, then back out again, speeding up each time until you're "running" against the floor.

              While the move sounds simple, mountain climbers exercise almost the entire body and raise your heart rate. You can easily add mountain climbers to your morning workout at home or the gym, in a hotel room while you're traveling, or even squeeze in a few in the break room at work. The basic move is great for beginners, but more experienced exercisers can take things up a notch with variations.
            <h4>Benefits </h4>
            <p>
              Mountain climbers are great for building cardio endurance, core strength, and agility. You work several different muscle groups with mountain climbers—it's almost like getting a total-body workout with just one exercise.

As you perform the move, your shoulders, arms, and chest work to stabilize your upper body while your core stabilizes the rest of your body. As the prime mover, your quads get an incredible workout, too. And because it's a cardio exercise, you'll get heart health benefits and burn calories.
<h4>Step-by-Step Instruction</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Get into a plank position, making sure to distribute your weight evenly between your hands and your toes.</li>
  <li>Check your form—your hands should be about shoulder-width apart, back flat, abs engaged, and head in alignment.</li>
  <li>Pull your right knee into your chest as far as you can.</li>
  <li>Switch legs, pulling one knee out and bringing the other knee in.</li>
  <li>Keep your hips down and run your knees in and out as far and as fast as you can. Alternate inhaling and exhaling with each leg change</li>

</ol>
