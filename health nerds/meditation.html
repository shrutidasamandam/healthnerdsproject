            <h2>WHAT IS MEDITATION?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Meditation can be defined as a set of techniques that are intended to encourage a heightened state of awareness and focused attention. Meditation is also a consciousness-changing technique that has been shown to have a wide number of benefits on psychological well-being.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            Some key things to note about meditation:
            <ul>
              <li>Meditation has been practiced in cultures all over the world for thousands of years.</li>
              <li>Nearly every religion, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, has a tradition of using meditative practices.</li>
              <li>While meditation is often used for religious purposes, many people practice it independently of any religious or spiritual beliefs or practices.</li>
              <li>Meditation can also be used as a psychotherapeutic technique.</li>
              <li>There are many different types of meditation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>TYPES</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Meditation can take on many different forms, but there are two main types: concentrative meditation and mindfulness meditation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Concentrative meditation involves focusing all of your attention on a specific thing while tuning out everything else around you. The goal is to really experience whatever you are focusing on, whether it's your breath, a specific word, or a mantra in order to reach a higher state of being.</li>
              <li>Mindfulness meditation includes, among others, both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Mindfulness can target different issues, such as depression, which means that its focus may be different from practice to practice. Overall, it involves the state of being aware of and involved in the present moment and making yourself open, aware, and accepting. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>HOW TO PRACTICE?</h2>
            <br>
            <hr>
            While there are many different forms of meditation and ways to practice, learning a basic meditation for beginners is a great place to begin:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Choose a quiet spot that is free of distractions. Turn off your phone, television, and other distractions. </b>If you choose to play quiet music, select something calm and repetitive</li>
              <li><b> a time limit.</b> If you are just getting started, you might want to stick to shorter sessions of about 5 to 10 minutes in length.</li>
              <li><b>Pay attention to your body and get comfortable.</b> You can sit cross-legged on the floor or in a chair as long as you feel that you can sit comfortably for several minutes at a time.</li>
              <li><b>Focus on your breathing. Try taking deep breaths that expand your belly and then slowly exhale.</b> Pay attention to how each breath feels.</li>
              <li><b>Notice your thoughts.</b> The purpose of meditation is not to clear your mindâ€”your mind is inevitably going to wander. Instead, focus on gently bringing your attention back to your breath whenever you notice your thoughts drifting. Don't judge your thoughts or try to analyze them; simply direct your mind back to your deep breathing.</li>
            </ul>
<h2>POTENTIAL PITFALLS</h2>
<hr>
Meditation can have a wide range of benefits, but there are also some potential pitfalls to watch for. As you are starting a new meditation habit, it can be easy to expect too much too quickly. The reality is that it takes time and practice to build a habit that can have a positive impact on your health and well-being.

Don't expect meditation to solve all of your problems. Instead, treat it like a part of your self-care routine that plays a role in helping you feel better and less stressed.

It is also important to be aware that meditation is not without some risks. One study found that meditation often led to troubling feelings and thoughts that were difficult to manage. The study also found that meditation might worsen the symptoms of some mental health conditions including anxiety and depression.

Some reports suggest that meditation may trigger or exacerbate psychotic states, so meditation may not be recommended for people who have conditions such as schizophrenia.
<h2>HISTORY OF MEDITATION</h2>
<hr>
While meditation has recently grown in popularity in the U.S., the practice actually dates back thousands of years. The practice has been associated with religious traditions, particularly Buddhism. Meditation was used throughout Asia but finally began to make its way to other parts of the world during the 20th century. It rose to prominence in the West during the 1960s and 1970s and was often associated with hippie culture.

Over the last few decades, meditation has also been incorporated into different treatment modalities including mindfulness-based stress reduction, an approach that incorporates mindfulness and meditation to help people coping with stress, depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.

The use of meditation as a therapeutic aid will likely continue to develop as researchers learn more about the benefits and applications of the practice.
