            <p> <h3>Lunges</h3>
                <br>1. Begin by standing shoulder-width apart with your arms down at your sides.</br>
                <br>2. Step forward with your right leg, bending your right knee, and halting when your thigh is parallel to the ground. Make sure your right knee doesn't go beyond your right foot. </br>
                <br>3. Return to the starting position by pushing up with your right foot. Reverse the process with your left leg. This is one repetition.</br>
                <br>4. Complete three sets of ten reps.</br>  
            </p>
            <p> <h3>Pushups</h3>
                <br>1. Begin by holding a plank position. Your core should be firm, your shoulders should be drawn down and back, and your neck should be in a neutral position.</br>
                <br>2. Begin lowering your body to the floor by bending your elbows. Extend your elbows and return to the start until your chest grazes it. Throughout the exercise, maintain your elbows tight to your body.</br>
                <br>3. Perform three sets of as many reps as you can.</br>
            </p>
            <p> <h3>Burpees</h3>
                <br>1. To begin, stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms at your sides. </br>
                <br>2. Begin squatting with your hands out in front of you. When your hands reach the ground, return to a pushup stance by straightening your legs. </br>
                <br>3. By bending at the waist, jump your feet up to your palms. Bring your feet as near to your hands as possible, landing them outside if necessary. </br>
                <br>4. Jump while standing up straight and raising your arms above your head.</br>
                <br>5. This is one repetition. As a beginner, do three sets of ten reps.</br>
            </p>
            <p> <h3>Glute Bridge</h3>
                <br>1. Begin by lying on your back with your knees bent, your feet flat on the ground, and your arms straight at your sides, palms facing down. </br>
                <br>2. Squeeze your core, glutes, and hamstrings while pushing through your heels to lift your hips off the ground.  </br>
                <br>3. Your upper back and shoulders should be in contact with the ground, and your core should make a straight line down to your knees. </br>
                <br>4. Return to the starting position after a 1–2 second pause at the top.</br>
                <br>5. Complete three sets of 10–12 repetitions.</br>
