                It's difficult to keep yourself motivated. In fact, I frequently compare it to one of Baron Munchausen's exploits: trying to maintain your motivation through a task, a project,
                 or even a career might feel like pulling yourself out of a swamp by your own hair. We appear to have an innate aversion to sustained effort, which no amount of 
                 caffeine or motivational posters can overcome.

                Effective self-motivation, on the other hand, is one of the major characteristics that distinguishes high-achieving professionals from the rest of the pack. 
                So, even when you don't feel like it, how can you keep going?

                The value of goal setting has been well proven by studies. Salespeople who set targets, for example, close more deals, and people who make daily exercise commitments 
                are more likely to improve their fitness levels, according to studies. Abstract goals like "doing your best" are rarely as helpful as realistic goals like bringing in 
                10 new clients per month or exercising 10,000 steps per day. As a general rule, any goals you create for yourself or that you agree to should be specific.

                Shift your perspective on the progress you've made. We tend to boost our effort when we've already made progress and the objective appears within reach. In loyalty programmes, 
                for example, are more likely to spend more as they get closer to receiving a reward. You can take advantage of this tendency by thinking of your starting point as being further in the past; 
                perhaps the project began when it was originally proposed, not when you first took action.

            <p> 
                Finally, know that the people who will best motivate you to complete specific duties are not necessarily those who will do the tasks well. Instead, they're intimate friends and family, as well as mentors, who 
                share a big-picture aim with you. Thinking about those people and our desire to succeed on their behalf might give the intense intrinsic motivation we require to achieve our objectives. A lady may find dullness at work 
                enjoyable if she believes she is setting a good example for her daughter; 
                a man may find it easier to keep to his fitness programme if it makes him feel more lively around his friends.

                    Flow is defined in positive psychology as a mental state in which someone is fully involved in a task, with energised focus and enjoyment. Unfortunately, in ordinary life, that feeling might be brief or elusive. 
                    We often feel like Baron Munchausen in the marsh, unable to make progress toward our objectives. In those instances, it can be beneficial to use internal and extrinsic motivators, properly arrange rewards, shift our 
                    emphasis back or forward depending on how near we are to the finish line, and use social influence. 
                    Self-motivation is one of the most difficult qualities to master, yet it is essential for success.
